The project is implemented using JavaScript and HTML as programming language, and is styled using CSS. The data structure used is ‘array’. Various functions are performed on this 2D array. Each array element contains a question, 4 options, and the correct answer. I’ve stored a total of 10 questions in the code and set the max no. of questions to be asked in the quiz as 5. This can be changed according to the needs of the body organizing the quiz. 1.Each question is compulsory

Every question has 4 options, out of which only 1 is correct
For every correct answer, 10 points are awarded
There is no negative marking
Once answered, it cannot be modified and the next question will be displayed immediately
A correct answer is indicated by a green colour, while an incorrect answer is indicated by a red colour
A progress bar is displayed on the top left, which indicates the number of questions answered
